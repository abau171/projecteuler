# Project Euler Solutions
*My own Project Euler solutions written in Python 3.*

###Important Note
Project Euler explicitly discourages posting of solutions. In the spirit of
the project's goal to "provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve
into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational
context," please feel free to explore my solutions only *AFTER* you have
given an honest attempt at solving them yourself.

The solutions in this repo are *very nearly* 100% the result of my own ideas
or non-Project Euler-specific research on math and algorithms.

###Running
All solutions should execute without errors by running
`python3 solution/p<problem number>.py` from the repo root.

###Utilities
I try to identify when I am using a particular technique many times throughout
my solutions, and create reusable utilities in the `solutions/utils/` directory.
